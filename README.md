`shuffleDNS` is a wrapper around `massdns`, written in go, that allows you to enumerate valid subdomains using active bruteforce, as well as resolve subdomains with wildcard handling and easy input-output support.

Based on the work on `massdns` project by [@blechschmidt](https://github.com/blechschmidt).

 # Features

</h1>

 - Simple and modular code base making it easy to contribute.
 - Fast And Simple active subdomain scanning.
 - Handles wildcard subdomains in a smart manner.
 - Optimized for **ease of use**
 - **Stdin** and **stdout** support for integrating in workflows

# Usage

```bash
shuffledns -h
```
This will display help for the tool. Here are all the switches it supports.

## Prerequisite

`shuffledns` requires `massdns` to be installed in order to perform its operations. You can see the installation instructions at [massdns project](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns#compilation). If you place the binary in `/usr/bin/massdns` or `/usr/local/bin/massdns`, the tool will auto-detect the presence of the binary and use it. On Windows, you need to supply the path to the binary for the tool to work.

The tool also needs a list of valid resolvers. The [dnsvalidator](https://github.com/vortexau/dnsvalidator) project can be used to generate these lists. You also need to provide wordlist, you can use a custom wordlist or use the [commonspeak2-wordlist](https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/manual/best-dns-wordlist.txt).

## Installation Instructions

`shuffledns` requires `go1.21+` to install successfully. Run the following command to install the latest version: 

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns/cmd/shuffledns@latest
```

## Running shuffledns

`shuffledns` supports two types of operations:

<ins>**Subdomain resolving**</ins>

To resolve a list of subdomains, you can pass the list of subdomains via the `-list` option.

```bash
shuffledns -d example.com -list example-subdomains.txt -r resolvers.txt -mode resolve
```

This will run the tool against subdomains in `example-subdomains.txt` and returns the results. The tool uses the resolvers specified with `-r` flag to do the resolving.

You can also pass the list of subdomains at standard input (STDIN). This allows for easy integration in automation pipelines.

```bash
subfinder -d example.com | shuffledns -d example.com -r resolvers.txt
```

This uses the subdomains found passively by `subfinder` and resolves them with `shuffledns` returning only the unique and valid subdomains.

<ins>**Subdomain Bruteforcing**</ins>

`shuffledns` also supports bruteforce of a target with a given wordlist. You can use the `w` flag to pass a wordlist which will be used to generate permutations that will be resolved using massdns.

```bash
shuffledns -d hackerone.com -w wordlist.txt -r resolvers.txt
```

This will run the tool against `hackerone.com` with the wordlist `wordlist.txt`. The domain bruteforce can also be done with standard input as in previous example for resolving the subdomains.

```bash
echo hackerone.com | shuffledns -w wordlist.txt -r resolvers.txt
```

## Handling Wildcards

A special feature of `shuffleDNS` is its ability to handle multi-level DNS based wildcards, and do it so with a very reduced number of DNS requests. Sometimes all the subdomains would resolve, leading to lots of garbage in the results. The way `shuffleDNS` handles this is by keeping track of how many subdomains point to an IP, and if the number of subdomains increase beyond a certain small threshold, it checks for wildcard on all the levels of the hosts for that IP iteratively.

### Notes

- Wildcard filter feature works with domain (`-d`) input only.
- Resolving or Brute-forcing only one operation can be done at a time.
